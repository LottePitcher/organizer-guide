- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.

# Some ideas to improve the guide: 
- Add some [FAQs](..//Organiser-Advice/FAQ.md)
- Links to slides/videos of talks that other meetup organizers can use 
- Example of topics / trending topics / topics already covered in other meetups 
- Example of agendas 
- Email/communication templates (Speakers invitations, reminders, announcements)
- Best practices for promoting the group and events (Social Media, meetup.com platform,â€¦)
- Resources for finding sponsorship
- Ideas for finding venues

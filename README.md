This guide aims to help Umbracians who would like to start their local Umbraco meetup group. These are general guidelines based on the experience of the Umbraco meetups organizers, as well as other [communities](#Acknowledgments) that have been doing an impressive job building and maintaining community events. 

Meetup.com provides as well a more detailed list of resources for the organizers:  

- [Meetup.com's Organizer stories, tips, and best practices](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000229871 )
- [Meetup.com's Organizers Network](https://meetup.com/pro/organizers)

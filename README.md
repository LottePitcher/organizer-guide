# Starting and Running an Umbraco Meetup Group

## Who can start an Umbraco meetup group?

Any Umbracian that would like to start and run a meetup!  The Umbraco meetup organizers represent diverse passionate people with different backgrounds, interests, and skills. So if you are thinking about starting a meetup group in your city, H5YR! and keep reading :) 

## How likely is it that the meetup group will be successful? 

The answer depends on various factors. But ONE thing will definitely make a difference and increase the chances for the group to be successful and sustainable: CONSISTENCY. Regularly holding meetups even when the attendance is not as high as you would want it to be, will increase the chances for the group to be successful. For example, setting up a dedicated day for the meetup helps keep you going and offers the group members the chance to plan for their attendance. 

Not every meetup is monthly, it might be every other month or even just a few times a year. Listen to what works for your local community members.

At the start, it can be a bit challenging to commit to a 6-month or a year plan, but in the long run, this process will pay off. 


## How do I set up a new Umbraco meetup group?

You can create a new group on [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com). Membership to meetup.com is free, but once you want to become an organizer, a subscription fee is required. You shouldn't worry about this part, as Umbraco HQ covers the subscription if you are part of the [Umbraco meetup Pro network](https://www.meetup.com/pro/umbraco).   


## Umbraco Meetup Pro Network

Umbraco HQ started using Meetup Pro back in August 2018 as a tool to provide more structured support to the meetup organizers. Meetup Pro enables Umbraco HQ to pay the meetup subscription fees while allowing the organizers to retain full control over their meetup groups. 


### What is Meetup Pro?
Compared to "normal" Meetup, Meetup Pro gives Umbraco HQ the possibility to cover the subscription fees and help you share the responsibilities as a meetup organizer with other people. It also gives you the option to step down in case things get busy and you prefer to focus on something else or take a small break. In brief, it makes managing a meetup group more of a community effort than a 1-person responsibility. 

You will still retain full control over your Meetup page as a co-organizer. The only difference is we get to help you! 

### What do I get from being part of the network?
- Umbraco HQ pays the organizer subscription fees for your Meetup group;
- Your local community is part of the global Umbraco Meetup community (i.e. the [Umbraco public network profile](https://www.meetup.com/pro/umbraco/) will display your Umbraco group along with other Umbraco Meetup groups);
- Depending on where you are, you can make use of [WeWork space](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003890332-Meetup-WeWork-Locations) for free. Once you are part of the network, you can book WeWork space from the Meetup platform, you should be able to select a room based on the number of attendees you are planning to have for your event.  

### How do I get access to the Network?

#### 1- I have not created a meetup group yet

Umbraco HQ can create a group for you and add you as a Co-organizer. If you are considering running your own Umbraco meetup group, [get in touch](mailto:ilham@umbraco.com) with the following information:
 - Location 
 - Name of the group
 - Description
 - If available, an agenda for the first event 

#### 2- I have already created a meetup group

If you have already created an Umbraco meetup group, [send us a message](mailto:ilham@umbraco.com) with the subject "Meetup Transfer for (Umbraco meetup - Location)" and we will complete the process on our end.
Make sure to cancel your Meetup subscription as it will not automatically cancel.

 
### How do I promote the new meetup group? 

- Set up a twitter account for the new group to help promote it. Remember to hashtag #umbraco or #umbracomeetup, and make your own meetup group related hashtag.
- Use LinkedIn to share the meetup invite with people in your professional network.
- Use the channels #announcement, #meetups, and #meetup-organisers on the [Community Slack](http://umbracians.chat/) to get the word out there. 
- Attend other related meetup groups and if possible, partner with the organizers of crossover meetups (.NET, CMS, Content strategy, etc.)
- Write a blog post about the experience. Check out the section [Community resources](#community-resources) to see some examples. 
- Umbraco HQ provides image templates that you can use to create digital banners to promote the meetup. 
  - [To use the template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13em4nVjEh46tMl7hFVoTHs1UgOEYydBw6qQXok8uni8), select and copy the slides, update the name of the meetup, city, date, speakers' name, and download in the format you will need for the promotion.
 - Get in touch with [Skrift.io](https://skrift.io/contact-us/) team to include your meetup in their newsletter.

### Content and speakers

  - The content/topics depend on the format you choose for the meetup event as well as what the local community would like to see.
  
  - Topics could be Umbraco best practices, news from the local community, contributions to the core and the documentation, presentations of use cases and demos, etc. You can also ask for suggestions for topics and speakers from the group members, on Twitter, Slack, or by sending them a message on meetup.com
  
 - If you would like to use an "official" Umbraco template for the presentations at your meetup, you are welcome to copy this [slides template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FdK4eYpX0tujZyx49T6Nt4e1d9ouJjvm5p2r2LPodNM).  
 
 - Here are some resources that you can use for your content (More material will be added to this list):   
     - Slides presentation outlining the contribution process to the Umbraco CMS/Docs project: [We're in this together by Sebastiaan Janssen at the UK festival 2018](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y7606uk0RRWUm2Ih0peRcP_gQLtv4-sZxEaF8tqIsDQ)
     - There are also recordings of [Codegarden presentations](https://vimeo.com/umbraco) that you can use for your meetups.
 
 - The meetup organizers are welcome to share presentations and videos that other organizers can reuse and adapt to their events. 

- Finding speakers can be challenging. The best place to start would be the local community. Umbraco meetups and festivals usually feature great speakers that cover different Umbraco topics. You can have a look at the list of [Umbraco festivals](http://umbracofestival.com/2018) or previous [Codegarden presentations](https://vimeo.com/umbraco) to find ideas for potential speakers in your local area. 

- Getting in contact with other meetup organizers for doing a talk or exchanging ideas can be very helpful as well. 

- Get in touch with speakers who have given a talk at other meetups, maybe they could also present at yours, or via video call if located too far away from your city.

- You are also invited to contribute by adding links to presentations or recordings of talks from your own meetup. 

### Finding a venue

- If you cannot make use of WeWork space, you can try some of the solutions that other meetup organizers rely on. Try to contact the organizers of some of the meetups in the same area and ask if they would introduce you to their hosts. 

- Try contacting other Umbraco users, agencies and companies using Umbraco in the same area, they might be able to host you or help find someone in the community who can.

- Some meetups host their events in a social setting such as a bar, cafe or even bowling!

## I can't find speakers or my speaker canceled. What else can I do?

It is not always easy to find speakers. Your meetup doesn't always need to follow the same format. Here are some ideas for what you can do instead: 

- Hackathon  
- Q&A Session
- Basic Social / networking 
- Latest Umbraco Community News
- Open Agenda Style: attendees suggest topics to discuss as a group (on post its or whiteboard). If too many to discuss in one meetup, vote on the most popular.

## My meetup only gets a few people, what am I doing wrong?

Starting a meetup takes patience and perseverance! You're not doing anything wrong, but we can understand the frustration. When looking at other bigger meetup groups such as the .NET Foundation meetups, one could feel a bit discouraged, but holding an Umbraco meetup with 5-10 people is really a great thing. What's important is to not give up and make sure to hold regular get-togethers. 

## I cannot keep up and I would like to step down

That is completely fine and we understand that it might be a bit too demanding. Family comes first as well as other commitments. It is for this reason that we always recommend having at least 2 extra co-organizers so you can share the workload and also be able to step down when necessary. The good news is that with Umbraco being the "main organizer", we can easily take over and hand over the reins to someone else that you could recommend or help select. So no stress and hope you can still join the meetups as attendee :) 

## Community resources

### Connect with other Umbraco meetup organizers
- Chat with other Umbraco meetup organizers on [the Umbraco community Slack](http://umbracians.chat/) by joining the channel meetup-organisers. 

### Get inspiration from other formats of Umbraco meetups initiated by the friendly community

### 6 tips from Heather 

Heather Floyd, [organizer of the Umbraco New York Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/The-New-York-Umbraco-Meetup/), shares six great tips that cover her experience about starting an Umbraco meetup group. 


**Tip 1**: If possible, find a partner to host with. The co-organizers can bounce ideas off each other, decide on dates, and keep each other company at the meetup if they are the only ones to show up

**Tip 2**: Experiment with the venue/format. Your local culture is probably different, so you might want to try a variety of formats and locations for your event to find out what people prefer. If you’ve had some regulars, try asking them what they think would be most effective and fun.

**Tip 3**: Though we have found that having defined topics is helpful, don’t stress about the content delivery – it doesn’t have to be fancy. Initially, it will be the hosts doing the presentations, but then you can ask for volunteers to present about interesting things they are doing.

**Tip 4**: Pay attention to visits to your area by willing Umbracians and plan a meetup featuring them! You might at least be able to piggy-back on nearby scheduled Umbraco training by roping the instructor into a meetup visit.

**Tip 5**: Advertise. Whatever platform you use to manage your events, make sure there is a way to gather a list of attendees to contact about future meetups. Also, don’t underestimate the simple stuff: Twitter, Skrift, and Umbraco HQ.

**Tip 6**: Keep at it. Don’t get discouraged by low attendance, especially at first. Just keep scheduling the events at regular intervals.

### Copy Alan's Trello board 

Alan Mac Kenna, [organizer of the Umbraco Ireland Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Umbraco-Ireland-Meetup/), has put together some practical suggestions for running a first Umbraco meetup. They are all neatly organized in a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/C5PF88CD).

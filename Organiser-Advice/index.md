  - The content/topics depend on the format you choose for the meetup event as well as what the local community would like to see.
  
  - Topics could be Umbraco best practices, news from the local community, contributions to the core and the documentation, presentations of use cases and demos, etc. You can also ask for suggestions for topics and speakers from the group members, on Twitter, Slack, or by sending them a message on meetup.com
  
 - If you would like to use an "official" Umbraco template for the presentations at your meetup, you are welcome to copy this [slides template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FdK4eYpX0tujZyx49T6Nt4e1d9ouJjvm5p2r2LPodNM).  
 
 - Here are some resources that you can use for your content (More material will be added to this list):   
     - Slides presentation outlining the contribution process to the Umbraco CMS/Docs project: [We're in this together by Sebastiaan Janssen at the UK festival 2018](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y7606uk0RRWUm2Ih0peRcP_gQLtv4-sZxEaF8tqIsDQ)
     - There are also recordings of [Codegarden presentations](https://vimeo.com/umbraco) that you can use for your meetups.
 
 - The meetup organizers are welcome to share presentations and videos that other organizers can reuse and adapt to their events. 

- Finding speakers can be challenging. The best place to start would be the local community. Umbraco meetups and festivals usually feature great speakers that cover different Umbraco topics. You can have a look at the list of [Umbraco festivals](http://umbracofestival.com/2018) or previous [Codegarden presentations](https://vimeo.com/umbraco) to find ideas for potential speakers in your local area. 

- Getting in contact with other meetup organizers for doing a talk or exchanging ideas can be very helpful as well. 

- Go along to other local tech meetups. Even if not Umbraco, you may meet speakers who can share their experience with Umbraco community.

- Get in touch with speakers who have given a talk at other meetups, maybe they could also present at yours, or via video call if located too far away from your city.

- You are also invited to contribute by adding links to presentations or recordings of talks from your own meetup. 

# Finding a venue

- If you cannot make use of WeWork space, you can try some of the solutions that other meetup organizers rely on. Try to contact the organizers of some of the meetups in the same area and ask if they would introduce you to their hosts. 

- Try contacting other Umbraco users, agencies and companies using Umbraco in the same area, they might be able to host you or help find someone in the community who can.

- Some meetups host their events in a social setting such as a bar, cafe or even bowling!

- Universities/ Schools are often keen to host tech meetups. Get in touch with the computing department at your local university or college!

# I can't find speakers or my speaker canceled. What else can I do?

It is not always easy to find speakers. Your meetup doesn't always need to follow the same format. Here are some ideas for what you can do instead: 

- Hackathon  
- Q&A Session
- Basic Social / networking 
- Latest Umbraco Community News
- Open Agenda Style: attendees suggest topics to discuss as a group (on post its or whiteboard). If too many to discuss in one meetup, vote on the most popular.
- Show & Tell: attendees can show off some of their Umbraco solutions, telling us how it was built and sharing any learnings from the project

# My meetup only gets a few people, what am I doing wrong?

Starting a meetup takes patience and perseverance! You're not doing anything wrong, but we can understand the frustration. When looking at other bigger meetup groups such as the .NET Foundation meetups, one could feel a bit discouraged, but holding an Umbraco meetup with 5-10 people is really a great thing. What's important is to not give up and make sure to hold regular get-togethers. 

# I cannot keep up and I would like to step down

That is completely fine and we understand that it might be a bit too demanding. Family comes first as well as other commitments. It is for this reason that we always recommend having at least 2 extra co-organizers so you can share the workload and also be able to step down when necessary. The good news is that with Umbraco being the "main organizer", we can easily take over and hand over the reins to someone else that you could recommend or help select. So no stress and hope you can still join the meetups as attendee :)

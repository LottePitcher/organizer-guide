# I can't find speakers or my speaker canceled. What else can I do?

It is not always easy to find speakers. Your meetup doesn't always need to follow the same format. Here are some ideas for what you can do instead: 

- Hackathon  
- Q&A Session
- Basic Social / networking 
- Latest Umbraco Community News
- Open Agenda Style: attendees suggest topics to discuss as a group (on post its or whiteboard). If too many to discuss in one meetup, vote on the most popular.
- Show & Tell: attendees can show off some of their Umbraco solutions, telling us how it was built and sharing any learnings from the project

# My meetup only gets a few people, what am I doing wrong?

Starting a meetup takes patience and perseverance! You're not doing anything wrong, but we can understand the frustration. When looking at other bigger meetup groups such as the .NET Foundation meetups, one could feel a bit discouraged, but holding an Umbraco meetup with 5-10 people is really a great thing. What's important is to not give up and make sure to hold regular get-togethers. 

# I cannot keep up and I would like to step down

That is completely fine and we understand that it might be a bit too demanding. Family comes first as well as other commitments. It is for this reason that we always recommend having at least 2 extra co-organizers so you can share the workload and also be able to step down when necessary. The good news is that with Umbraco being the "main organizer", we can easily take over and hand over the reins to someone else that you could recommend or help select. So no stress and hope you can still join the meetups as attendee :)

# Starting and Running an Umbraco Meetup Group

## Who can start an Umbraco meetup group?

Any Umbracian that would like to start and run a meetup!  The Umbraco meetup organizers represent diverse passionate people with different backgrounds, interests, and skills. So if you are thinking about starting a meetup group in your city, H5YR! and keep reading :) 

## How likely is it that the meetup group will be successful? 

The answer depends on various factors. But ONE thing will definitely make a difference and increase the chances for the group to be successful and sustainable: CONSISTENCY. Regularly holding meetups even when the attendance is not as high as you would want it to be, will increase the chances for the group to be successful. For example, setting up a dedicated day for the meetup helps keep you going and offers the group members the chance to plan for their attendance. 

Not every meetup is monthly, it might be every other month or even just a few times a year. Listen to what works for your local community members.

At the start, it can be a bit challenging to commit to a 6-month or a year plan, but in the long run, this process will pay off. 


## How do I set up a new Umbraco meetup group?

You can create a new group on [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com). Membership to meetup.com is free, but once you want to become an organizer, a subscription fee is required. You shouldn't worry about this part, as Umbraco HQ covers the subscription if you are part of the [Umbraco meetup Pro network](https://www.meetup.com/pro/umbraco).   


## Umbraco Meetup Pro Network

Umbraco HQ started using Meetup Pro back in August 2018 as a tool to provide more structured support to the meetup organizers. Meetup Pro enables Umbraco HQ to pay the meetup subscription fees while allowing the organizers to retain full control over their meetup groups. 


### What is Meetup Pro?
Compared to "normal" Meetup, Meetup Pro gives Umbraco HQ the possibility to cover the subscription fees and help you share the responsibilities as a meetup organizer with other people. It also gives you the option to step down in case things get busy and you prefer to focus on something else or take a small break. In brief, it makes managing a meetup group more of a community effort than a 1-person responsibility. 

You will still retain full control over your Meetup page as a co-organizer. The only difference is we get to help you! 

### What do I get from being part of the network?
- Umbraco HQ pays the organizer subscription fees for your Meetup group;
- Your local community is part of the global Umbraco Meetup community (i.e. the [Umbraco public network profile](https://www.meetup.com/pro/umbraco/) will display your Umbraco group along with other Umbraco Meetup groups);
- Depending on where you are, you can make use of [WeWork space](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003890332-Meetup-WeWork-Locations) for free. Once you are part of the network, you can book WeWork space from the Meetup platform, you should be able to select a room based on the number of attendees you are planning to have for your event.  

### How do I get access to the Network?

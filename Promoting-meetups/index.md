 
# How do I promote the new meetup group? 

- Set up a twitter account for the new group to help promote it. Remember to hashtag #umbraco or #umbracomeetup, and make your own meetup group related hashtag.
- Use LinkedIn to share the meetup invite with people in your professional network.
- Use the channels #announcement, #meetups, and #meetup-organisers on the [Community Slack](http://umbracians.chat/) to get the word out there. 
- Attend other related meetup groups and if possible, partner with the organizers of crossover meetups (.NET, CMS, Content strategy, etc.)
- Write a blog post about the experience. Check out the section [Community resources](#community-resources) to see some examples. 
- Umbraco HQ provides image templates that you can use to create digital banners to promote the meetup. 
  - [To use the template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13em4nVjEh46tMl7hFVoTHs1UgOEYydBw6qQXok8uni8), select and copy the slides, update the name of the meetup, city, date, speakers' name, and download in the format you will need for the promotion.
 - Get in touch with [Skrift.io](https://skrift.io/contact-us/) team to include your meetup in their newsletter.
